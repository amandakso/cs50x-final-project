# CALENDAR PLUS WEB APP
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/mznLh4Guu94
#### Description:
CALENDAR PLUS is a web application utilizing html, CSS, javascript, and python I created for the final project of Harvard CS50x course. This web application allows users to add events to a personalized calendar. The homepage shows the calendar of the current month along with the number events occurring on each day. The homepage also shows the events of that month listed below the calendar. 

Features of CALENDAR PLUS includes options to update user settings, change the month/year of the displayed calendar, and change the background color of the calendar.

Some design ideas had to be modified or abandoned due to limiations of tie and/or coding capabilities. Some web features I wanted to include initially were having more interactivity between users such as friending others and inviting users to events. I also wanted to let users have the ability to create event pages. Another feature was to have functionality to event buttons so that it would display an individual date's events. However, for the current version all of the month's events are displayed at the bottom instead. Distinct radio type inputs for background color options were chosen rather than any color choice to ensure the month/year title were legible for ever color option.
